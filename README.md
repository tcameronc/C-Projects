Instructions with demonstration (shorturl.at/cdE29)

This snake game is coded in C. I recommend using this compiler.

The goal of the game is to collect the trophies until the tail is half the length of the perimeter. Each trophy gives the number of points it shows and grows the tail the same amount.

The trophies expire after a set period of time, and the snake gets faster with each trophy collected.

Crashing into the walls or the tail will end the game. 

Coming soonâ€¦
